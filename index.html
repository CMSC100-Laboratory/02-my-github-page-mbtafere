                            ðŸ“„ Know about me: I'm from Bay, Laguna, where I was born and raised. As a child, and for a good part of my junior high years, I wasn't very interested in computers or digital devices maybe due to lack of exposure to those things. Instead, I spent most of my time outside, playing with my neighbors and friends. I chose Computer Science program at the very last minute as I am not really sure what I want to take and pursue that's why I entered college with no prior knowledge about computer programming.

                        <p>
                            ðŸŽ® Hobbies: I love watching short-form videos, which is a great way for me to relax and stay entertained. I also like playing games, mostly on mobile.
